    <p><span>Please read carefully. By submitting content, including but not limited to text, video, pictures, graphics, designs, information, applications, software, music, audio files, articles, directories, guides, photographs, or any other file type (“content”) you agree to be bound by these terms which include, among others, you are giving us broad rights to use your “content” as defined herein, your agreement to resolve disputes through binding arbitration, you are making certain warranties and representations, and your broad agreement to release us from any liability in connection with your participation.</span>

    <div class="privacyTitle">Agreement</div>

    <p>I am submitting my Content and the additional information I have provided to be considered for the above role. I
      understand and agree that if the “Production” (as defined below) decides to select me for the role, I will have to
      meet any other requirements (including, without limitation, submitting to a background check) set by them at the
      time of such consideration.</p>

    <p>My submission of my Content to Bitty Casting, LLC (“<span>Company</span>”) is voluntary and not in confidence. I
      acknowledge and agree that the relationship between myself and Company is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other
      special relationship, and that my decision to provide my Content to Company does not place Company in a position
      that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to my Content. I
      understand that once I submit my Content for a particular Project, they cannot be removed from
      www.bittycasting.com (the “<span>Website</span>”) until casting for the “Project” (as defined herein) has been
      completed.</p>

    <p>I understand and agree that my Content will be used for purposes of casting the Project. In the event I am
      selected for the Project, I understand and agree to enter into a separate agreement with the Production, which
      will be provided to me at a later date. I understand and agree that the decision about who to include in the
      Project shall be made by the Production (and not Company) in its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final
      and binding and not subject to appeal. I understand that the Production is soliciting my Content because it is
      actively seeking to find the right person for the applicable role, but I understand that the Production is under
      no obligation to review my Content or commence production on the Project or continue production once commenced.
      Finally, I understand and agree that Company is not responsible for the archival of any Content and I should
      retain my own copy of the Content for my records.</p>

      without the need for further consent or payment to me or to anyone else.</p>

    <div class="privacyTitle">Agreement to binding arbitration</div>

    <p>By submitting the Content, you (and your parent or legal guardian if you are a minor) unconditionally consent and
      agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against
      the officers, directors and employees of Company and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates (all such individuals
      and entities collectively referred to herein as the “<span>Company Entities</span>”) arising out of, relating to,
      or connected in any way with this Agreement or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement
      to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted
      before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to
      a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
      (“<span>FAA</span>”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in Seattle, Washington; (4) the
      arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any of the other
      agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the website; (5)
      the arbitrator shall apply Washington State law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations,
      and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be
      arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Company
      Entity’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who
      may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or

      arbitration against any Company Entity exceed $125 USD, and your are unable (or not required under the rules of
      JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Company agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your
      behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the
      costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of your
      filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
      arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this
      arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of
      JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance
      with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If,
      however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration
      Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Company shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</p>
