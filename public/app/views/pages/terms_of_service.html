      videos, photographs, drawings, or original artwork that you expect to be compensated for or that you would like to
      keep private. If you send or post certain specific submissions at our request (e.g., via message boards or in

      according you any compensation. By submitting a Submission to the Site or Company, you represent that such

      exploitation or use of any material you submit to the Site and/or Company, the damage, if any, thereby caused will

      enjoin the exploitation or other use of any Company platform, product or service based on or allegedly based on

    <div class="privacyTitle">Governing Law</div>

    <p>This TOS shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington applicable to
      contracts entered into and fully performed in Washington (without regard to its conflicts of law principles that
      would cause the application of any other jurisdiction's laws). With respect to any disputes or claims not subject
      to arbitration, you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state

      Seattle, Washington.</p>

    <div class="privacyTitle">Arbitration</div>

    <p>By using the Site in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy
      (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against the officers, directors and employees of Company
      and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the
      “Company Entities”) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the website or the determination of
      the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding
      arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2)
      you will give Company no less than 60 days’ notice of your intention to file any claim, in order that you and
      Company may attempt to settle such claim outside of formal court or arbitration proceedings; (3) this arbitration
      agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal
      Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (4) the arbitration shall be held in Seattle, Washington; (5) the
      arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any of the other
      agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the website; (6)
      the arbitrator shall apply Washington law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and
      shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (7) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated
      on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Company Entity’s
      individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be
      similarly situated; (8) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any
      Company Entity; (9) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate

      JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Company agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your
      behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the
      costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of your
      filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
      arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (10) with the exception of subpart (7) above, if any part of this
      arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of
      JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance
      with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If,
      however, subpart (7) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration
      Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Company shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</p>
